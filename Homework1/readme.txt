here we should create the project file so the repo sees it right. naming convention requires us to name the project in a certain manner but we need to be able to push it to git for synchronous development.  i think there is no need to create a new repo for each homework so this is my solution.

after you pull the project from git, you should add it to your workspace by importing it as an existing project. then you select the homework1 folder as the root folder and select the project from the list and you're good to go. 

ask me, if there is a problem
